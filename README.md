# Data-Professional-Industry-Survey-Analysis

Project Overview: Designed and deployed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze workforce trends within the data industry. The project involved cleaning and visualizing survey data from 630 professionals across the US, UK, India, and Canada to uncover insights regarding salary discrepancies, barrier to entry, and job satisfaction.

Key Technical Implementations:

Data Modeling: Transformed raw survey data to create relationships between demographics, job titles, and compensation metrics.

Visualization: Built comparative charts for "Average Salary by Job Title" and "Programming Language Popularity."

DAX Measures: Calculated average satisfaction scores (Salary vs. Work/Life Balance) and average respondent age (29.8 years).

Key Insights Uncovered:


Salary Trends: Identified a significant earnings gap, with Data Scientists averaging $94k compared to Data Analysts at $55k.




Tooling: Validated Python as the industry-standard language, significantly outperforming R and SQL in popularity.



Workforce Sentiment: Revealed a "satisfaction gap" where professionals rated Work/Life Balance (5.74/10) significantly higher than Salary Satisfaction (4.27/10).




Entry Barriers: Visualized that only 7% of respondents perceive breaking into the data industry as "Very Difficult," challenging common misconceptions.


Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI, Power Query, DAX.
